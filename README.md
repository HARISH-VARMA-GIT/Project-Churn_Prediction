# Project-Churn_Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for a churn prediction model developed using machine learning techniques. The project aims to help a banking company identify customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive measures to improve customer retention.

## Description
In this project, I developed a churn prediction model using machine learning techniques to help a banking company identify customers at risk of churning. Churn, or customer attrition, refers to the loss of customers over a specific period of time. By accurately predicting churn, the company can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Responsibilities and Accomplishments:
1. The Data has been Collected from Kaggle Datasets and the link for dataset :https://www.kaggle.com/code/taneresme/churn-prediction/input
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and identify relevant features for churn prediction.
3. Engineered new features, such as AgeBin, CreditScoreBin, BalanceBin, and EstimatedSalaryBin, to improve the predictive power of the model.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring appropriate data partitioning for model training and evaluation.
5. Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, KNN ,Naive Bayes and NeuralNet, to build predictive models.
6. Evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy and plotted ROC curves for all models

## Technologies and Tools Used:
1. Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
2. Popular libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, modeling, and evaluation.
3. Jupyter Notebook for an interactive and reproducible project workflow.
4. Visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions and model performance.

By successfully completing this churn prediction project, I demonstrated my proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation techniques in machine learning. The project also showcased my ability to derive actionable insights from data and provide valuable recommendations to drive business decisions.
